# What is a gregui?

This is an extremely simple GUI library, made only using the system level libraries. The project is currently only in development for windows, but when I have a better understanding of how GUI libraries work I 
might make it cross platform. I will say the library will probably not be very efficient or productive, and will certainly not be a replacement for any better industrial GUI libraries. This is only for me to
learn the basics of c++ and the Win32API. I will do my best to make this a helpful learning resource to anyone else wanting to make their own GUI library.

## Why did I name it gregui?
Well that's a stupid question honestly, its because it has the word Greg in it, and I thought it was funny.

# Should you make your own library?

Well I'm no expert, but it depends on what you are trying to accomplish; If you are trying to challenge yourself to learn, then I think a GUI library is a great first large project, because it teaches you the
fundamentals of interacting with the Win32API, and how libraries are commonly formatted.

# Why c++?

Because I hate myself!! Just kidding, I actually watched a youtube video about programming languages - yes shockingly original, I know - but I've had an ok experience with c++ so far. I mainly chose c++ because
because of its somewhat modern nature compared to c with only slight preformance negatives. If I am being honest it would probably have been better in rust or c, but I do enjoy the c++ language so I just went
with that.
